# ðŸŒŽ Windborne Global Balloon Tracking System

A full-stack, ML-powered **real-time atmospheric modeling platform** that collects, cleans, and predicts global weather balloon telemetry.  
The system automates data ingestion, transformation, forecasting, and visualization â€” providing live, short-term weather predictions from thousands of balloon data streams.

## ðŸš€ Overview

**Windborne** integrates a Python ETL pipeline, weather API ingestion, data interpolation, and an **LSTM forecasting model**, all deployed through a Dockerized microservice architecture.

Key features include:
- Automated 15-minute inference cycles via **APScheduler**
- Resilient batch ingestion with **adaptive rate limiting** and **caching**
- Robust **data validation and interpolation** for missing or partial weather data
- **LSTM-based forecasting** for short-term atmospheric predictions
- Fully **containerized** deployment on a **VPS (DigitalOcean Droplet)**
- **Interactive Flask UI** for real-time visualization and monitoring
